Title: Save it, feel it

What we did in this century,
must not be repeated hopefully
Deforestation have been done irreversably,
we should not do it repeatedly

Degradation of coral
is what we've done to animal
that lived in the ocean, that is consequential
we discover, destroy and it is nonconventional

This day it changes,
we do reforestation for the sake of diversities
Replant and growing trees are activities
that is a must and don't do destructivities

Animals and plant
do not think that they are insignicant
they are very important and significant
to our survival so that we could live on this planet.
