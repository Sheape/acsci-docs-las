- We reviewed back about the digestive system because it is the only lesson that have curing by medicines.
- Precriptions are good and doesn't hurt people. Don't misuse or abuse it.

Antagonist - bind the same receptor, doesn't produce respond instead block it.
Agonist - Occupy Receptors and activate them.
Receptors - Messenger and receives agonist and antagonist.
	Each receptors only respond to specific symptoms.

	1. Drug must have a specific characteristics such as Size, shape, atomic config, electrical charge
	2. must have necessary properties for each to transfer to the body
	3. must be easily inactivated or excreted from the body.

	Poisons are drugs with harmful effects. But any drugs can be poison if overdosed.

Toxicants - produces adverse biological effects
Toxins - specific proteins
Protein - toxicants cause

Drugs must less than 100 molecular weight. Can be solid, liquid, and gas.

If the drug is too large then dilution is longer.
gram (g), liter (l), and meter (m)

Drug Reactivity and Drug Bonds
	- Covalent - Strong bonds that are not easily broken
	- Electroestotatic - Weaker than covalent and often reversible. Common
	- Hydrophobic - Weakest. Highly lipid- based

Low reactivity - specific, short-acting effect
High reactivity - broad, long-acting effect. More side effects tho

Classification:
	Precription-Only Medicine (POM) - requires prescription. Has to be in pharmacy.
	Over-the-Counter Medicine (OTC) - No need prescription. Easily Recognizable diseases. 2-3 days. Must follow the labels and instruction.
	Therapheutic Classification - You know the use already. Clinical and physiological and doesn't have like scientific and explanation behind why it treats. Anti-Psychotic.
	Pharmacological classification - Similar to Therapeutic but focuses on Heart and Blood Vessels and calcium channel.
	Pharmacy wtf - Can be bought in pharmacy but needs supervision.

Breast Cancer Awareness - in the month of October

Cancer - root word to the greek doctor Hippocrates who is considered the "Father of the Medicine".
				Carcinos and carcinoma is referred to crab.

Cancer starts in genetic changes or genetic mutation. Commonly on DNA or something.
Tumors that are Benign are NOT cancerous.

Cells can also repair DNA damage. Severe damage of DNA cannot heal the body and won't regen anymore.
Early repair of DNA can cure cancer.

Types of Cancer Cells:
	Carcinoma originates in the skin or the tissue. It could form solid tumors.
	Sarcoma starts in the tissue that support and connect the body.
	Luekemia is the cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including bone marrow and the lymphatic system.
	Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is the fighting thingy.
	Myeloma is a type of bone marrow cancer.

200 forms of cancer.

Risk Factors:
 - Age -> Older people have higher
 - Genetics -> Family
 - Behaviors -> Lack of Exercise/tobacco
 - Viruses or Bacteria -> viruses that trigger certain cancers.
 - Exposure to chemicals -> Nickel, Radon, Lead.
 - Radiation -> it can kill cancer cells but if too much then death. Visible light and energy from phone doesn't cause it.

 Carcinogens

 Biopsy - is a sample of issue taken from the body in order to examine it more closely. A doctor should recommend a biopsy when an initial test suggests an area of tissue in
 					the body isn't normal.
 Ultrasound - uses sound waves to check.
 Xray - oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging.
 Mammography - special medical imaging that uses a low-dose x-ray system to see inside the breasts.
 Pap smear - also called a Pap test, is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women.
 HPV DNA test - whick look for DNA from cancer-causing HPV types 	in cervical cells.
 Fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) - which check for blood in stool.
 Computed tomography (CT)- which uses xray in computers.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - the use of magnetic fields and radio waves to check.
 Ultrasound, xray, CT, MRI - are painless but too much can increase the development of cancer.

Naked mole rats - they are only the species that doesn't have any cancer.
Hyaluron - retains the water and keeps the moisture of the skin. keeping it from clumping together and forming tumors. Lubricator.

Anti cancer drugs - avoids replication of DNA and RNA. Stops dividing.
	Chemotheraphy - destroy cancer cells. Attacks all rapidly dividing cells.
Neoplastic cells - abnormal growth of cells.
Total cell-kill

1. A single clogenic(colony) malignant cell - progeny(experimental animals). The life span of the host inversely proportional to the number of malignant cells.
Every session only kills 100mg per session. There are 1,000,000mg in a kilogram.

Major Classes of Anti Cancer Drugs:
 	1. Alkylating agents -

					// breaks DNA strands to avoid growth of malignant cell. The risk of luekemia after getting alkylating is highest about 5-10 years. //

			treats ex. Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and other malignants.
	2. Antimetabolites - called "cytotoxic". It do be killing cells.

					// Blocks essential enzymes to avoid the growth. //

					Can't divide into new cells.

	3. Anthracyclines or anthracycline antibiotics - from Streptomyces bacteria.
			Mode:
				1. preventing the replication
				2. stops the Copying of DNA and RNA
				3. damage the DNA and cell membranes
Chemotheraphy drugs:
	1. Doxorubin (Adriamycin) - the best and can kill cancers. But can also damage heart cells so bye bye.
	2. Cyclo
