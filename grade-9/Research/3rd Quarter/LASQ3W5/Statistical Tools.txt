Frequency Distribution

- how frequent data where seen or present

Measure of Central Tendency
- "Average"

1. Mean - real average
2. Median - arranging the numbers and looking the middle
3. Mode - the most frequent data.

Statistical Tests

Chi - square
T-test - 2 samples
Anova - 3 or more samples
Correlation

P-Value - tell us the probability of things.

Exercise:

15, 16, 16, 19, 23, 24, 35

Purpose:
 - Comparison: Any Difference?
 - Relationship: Any Connection?

Type of Data:
 Categorical Data: Qualitative
 Continuous Data: Quantitative

Choosing the Statistical Test:

 - Chi - Squared - Comparison and Categorical
    - All experiments are the same to all the number of levels/groups.
    - No limit in samples
 - T-Test - Comparison, Categorical and Continuous
     - 1 level/group (IV): 1-sample t-test
     - 2 level/group (IV): 2-sample unpaired t-test
		  : 2-sample paired t-test
      - 3+ levels/groups (IV): one-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance)
 - Correlation - Relationship and continuous
      - 1 IV & 1 DV: Pearson's correlation, Regression (Statistical Formula)

P - Value stands for probability value.
result is by chance alone. 

If the p-value is small, it means unlikely to have occured
Small p-value = greater than chance alone
Large p-value = result is within chance or normal sampling error.

p-value can be 0-1.

Alpha - a = 0.5 and a = 0.1
p = sig

with a = 0.5 
 p < a, the test is significant
 p > a, the test is not sigficant

with a = 0.1
 p < a, the test is significant
 p > a, the test is not significant.
