The respiratory system is found inside of our body. Oxygen travels from environment to our nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, epiglotis, larynx, trachea, lungs, bronchus, bronchioles and to the alveoli. It filters unnecessary gases through cilia and allows only the oxygen to pass through, then oxygen splits in to two bronchus and to alveoli, oxygen in air sacks is then going to exchange to capillaries which contains hemoglobin with carbon dioxide, then the carbon dioxide goes out to air sacks to our nose and exhale it then plants benefits from it, while the oxygen-rich hemoglobin is transported throughout the body.

The Circulatory system converts deoxygenated blood to oxygenated blood to keep our body temperature and active. Deoxygenated blood is converted from our different parts of our body entering vena cava(Inferior vena cava), to Right Atrium, Tricuspid Valve, Right Ventricle, Pulmonary Valve, Pulmonary Artery then entering the lungs to get oxygen and converting the deoxygenated blood to oxygenated then exiting the lungs to Pulmonary Vein, Left Atrium, Mistral Valve, Left Ventricle, Aortic Valve, and then releasing it to the part of our body through Aorta.
